## Investigating 2025-04-03 10:06a

arwen seems to be having RAM issues -- possibly due to a hardware problem. We recommend that you use [an alternative](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/servers/login-servers) for the time being.

## Monitoring  2025-04-03 2:06p

arwen is back online after removing a memory module.
