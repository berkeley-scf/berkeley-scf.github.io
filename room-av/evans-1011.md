The Jerzy Neyman room is configured as a Zoom Room to facilitate web
conferencing, traditional presentations, and the recording of either.

## Set Up

Projector  
Turn on the projector by pressing the **On** button at the top of the
remote control. After the presentation, please press the Standby button
to turn off the projector. There is an idle timer which will also put
the projector into standby mode.

Projector Screen  
You can raise or lower the projector screen through the controls on the
wall near the media cabinet.

iPad  
The iPad tablet should be powered on and running the Zoom Room
Controller application. If not, press the Zoom Room icon on the iPad
home screen.

## Start a Meeting

Turn on the projector if necessary. Tap the **Home** button on the
upper-left side of the iPad. Choose one of the methods below.

### Scheduled Meeting on Room Calendar

Previously scheduled meetings in this room can be joined with one-touch
from the iPad’s left column. To create them:

1.  Create a Google Calendar event and add a Zoom meeting to it with the
    [Zoom for Google Workspace
    extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/zoom_for_google_workspace/364750910244).
2.  Request a <a href="/node/7622" data-entity-substitution="canonical"
    data-entity-type="node"
    data-entity-uuid="804ec64e-e89b-4c2f-a415-0b9c9441809b">room
    reservation</a> by adding the room to the calendar event.

If you add the room, "Stat-Conf-1011 Jerzy Neyman Cap:36" to your
meeting on Google Calendar, and also add a Zoom meeting to the video
conference field, the meeting will appear on the in-room tablet's
display in the column to the left of the meeting control buttons,
beneath the day and time. Tap the **Join Meeting** button next to your
meeting.

### Existing Meeting on Personal Calendar

If there is an existing Zoom meeting that has not been added to the
room's calendar, you can still join the meeting from the room. Tap
**Join** and enter your meeting's ID and passcode.

### Instant Meeting

If you have not scheduled your meeting in advance, tap **New Meeting**.
Send the meeting ID and passcode to the meeting participants, or invite
them from within the meeting.
