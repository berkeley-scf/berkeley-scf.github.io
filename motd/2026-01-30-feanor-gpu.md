One of feanor's GPUs is offline. It is available for jobs, but we will need to
take feanor offline with little to no warning when the vendor requires us to
perform tests or maintenance. This will interrupt any running jobs.

Update: feanor will be offline starting on Tue. Feb. 10 for a GPU replacement.

Update #2: The technician wasn't able to make it through to the data center. The service will be rescheduled.

Update #3: A technician is on site and feanor is down for maintenance.
