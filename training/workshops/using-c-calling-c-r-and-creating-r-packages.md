title: "Using C++, calling C++ from R, and Creating R packages"
---
A standard approach to implementing computationally-intensive
statistical analyses and methods (including in R packages) is to code
the intensive portion of the computation in C++ and call this from R. In
addition, a standard way to distribute the implementation of a
statistical method is as an R package available through
[CRAN](http://www.cran.r-project.org). This
[tutorial](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~scf/paciorek-cppWorkshop.pdf)
and [accompanying demo
code](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~scf/paciorek-cppWorkshopCode.zip)
provides an introduction to C++ for statisticians, with a focus on
calling C/C++ code from R, as well as an introduction to creating R
packages.
