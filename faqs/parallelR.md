This tutorial covers a variety of parallel programming techniques for R,
in addition to some general guidelines on parallel programming and
information on using Amazon's EC2 to run virtual Linux machines and
clusters. The tutorial was prepared for the Berkeley Biostat graduate
students and presented in March 2015.

The tutorial and template code are [available on
github](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/parallelR-biostat-2015).Â  You
can clone the repository with a git clone, which can be done from the
Linux/Mac command line as:

``` programlisting
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-scf/parallelR-biostat-2015
```

If you're not familiar with Git, you can get all the material as a zip
file by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button in the lower left of the
