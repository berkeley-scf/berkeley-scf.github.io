We'll be doing some maintenance to the network interfaces of our file server starting today at 2p. Our goal is to increase the network bandwidth of our file server. We anticipate that the outage will be very brief (one minute), however there is a slim possibility we may have to reboot the machine. Running jobs should not be terminated in either case.
