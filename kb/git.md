title: "Private Git Repositories"
---
The SCF used to facilitate private git repositories via shared
filesystem spaces and UNIX permissions. We now recommend using more
broadly supported services.

## github.com

GitHub offers unlimited private repositories with up to three
collaborators per repository for free.

If instructors want students to use github.com as part of their
coursework, students will need to have or create their own github.com
account.

## github.berkeley.edu

[GitHub@Berkeley](https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/Github-Info/info-main/) is
an on-premise, enterprise instance of the GitHub product that is managed
by campus. You login with your CalNet ID, and must be a faculty, staff,
or student. Some other affiliates are eligible. It is not suitable for
public projects due to the login restriction.

Files larger than 100MB will not be accepted for checkin/commit and
users are requested to keep their overall repository size under 1GB.
