The iPads are a shared resource so you must not store any sensitive student
data on them such as course rosters.

change the WiFi network:

    The color around the slider should be green. ![Wi-Fi Slider](../images/wifi-slider.png){width="57px" height="41px"}
1.  Choose a UC Berkeley wireless network, presumably the main
    network: eduroam.

## Apple Pencil

1.  Some apps support the Apple Pencil as a scribbling utensil, while
    others recognize it as an extension of one’s finger.
1.  You will need to [charge the
    Pencil](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211019) periodically.

    wish to open in notability.

1.  If the document is multi-page, every page will be selected by
    default, You must unselect the pages that you don't need.
1.  Tap "import".  If an additional dialog with the list of imported
    files was generated, tap "done".
1.  Go to the Notability main page and select the new note.

## Authentication

Since the iPad belongs to the manager@stat.berkeley.edu Apple account,
some apps like the Apple App Store are affiliated with the account.
Other apps use a separate login. For example when using apps in the
Google suite, you can login using your bConnected account.

## Returning the iPad

- Sign out of each app, for example [Google
  Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6373157?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en).
- Delete any personal files and data.
