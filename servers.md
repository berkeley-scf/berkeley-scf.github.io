title: "SCF Cluster and Servers"
---

We operate a network of Linux and Macintosh computers. These include:

- stand-alone [login servers](./servers/login-servers.md) (used primarily for
  logging in, file manipulation, and the like),
- aÂ [Linux cluster](./servers/cluster.md),
- access to and assistance with the [campus Savio Linux
  cluster](./servers/savio.md) and
- a number of [GPUs](./servers/gpu-servers.md)

Our [dashboards](./servers/monitoring.md) can show you information about what resources are in use and available.
