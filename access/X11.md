This article describes the steps necessary to install X11 server software
on your home computer. This will enable you to display windows and
graphics created by applications running on remote UNIX systems.

## Windows X11 Forwarding

When you run an X server and an SSH client, you will launch programs
from the SSH window and the X server will be display them See these
[instructions](/access/ssh) for information on downloading and installing SSH
software.

Your Windows SSH client must be configured to forward X Window System
communication (i.e., graphical windows) from the machine you are
connecting to to your PC's display. In Putty, click on the plus sign to
the left of "SSH" in the left hand pane, then click "X11" and check the
box labelled "Enable X11 Forwarding". With MobaXterm you can also easily
forward graphical windows.

## Windows: Xming

Xming is the X Windows Software from [X.Org](http://www.x.org) ported to
Microsoft Windows. It shares source code with Cygwin's X server (see
below), but you do not need the full cygwin environment to run it. You
can use this X server in much the same way you use eXceed, though it
does not come with many of the features of eXceed. If, for some reason,
eXceed becomes unavailable to you, try this software. It can be
downloaded from <http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/>.

## macOS XQuartz

[XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) is an open source version of the
X11.app application that used to come preinstalled on macOS.

### Mac X11 Forwarding

For forwarding remote X sessions over ssh you can use either
**Terminal.app** (also found in `/Applications/Utilities`) or **xterm**.
If you are using the Mac OS X Terminal, you will need to set your
DISPLAY variable. Enter this statement into the file `~/.bashrc`:

:::{code} bash
if [ -z $DISPLAY ]; then export DISPLAY=:0.0; fi
:::

and then start a new Terminal window. If you are using xterm, the
variable should be set for you.

On the Mac you should also use the -X and -Y options:

:::{code} shell
ssh -X -Y username@hostname
:::
