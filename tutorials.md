The SCF and partners have prepared a number of online self-study tutorials. Anyone is welcome to use the materials, including as part of a class.

Most of the tutorials come as websites hosted on GitHub Pages with the content living in a GitHub repository. For some of the older tutorials that have not been updated recently, there is only a GitHub repository.
