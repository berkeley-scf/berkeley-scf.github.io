The mission of the SCF is to provide the Statistics community with
state-of-the-art computing infrastructure, services, and
consulting/troubleshooting to support both research and teaching. We
strive to enable cutting-edge research activities, innovative
instructional programs, and effective administration and communication
within the community. To carry out its mission in support of our users,
the SCF will:

- Communicate with, understand, and support the needs of our community
  as computing technologies evolve.
- Evaluate emerging software and hardware.
- Regularly evaluate and refine the design and delivery of its services
  and supporting infrastructure.
- Maintain the security of our systems, protect the privacy of
  individuals, and assure the integrity of data.
- Ensure that computing infrastructure is remotely accessible 24 hours a
  day, seven days a week.

The SCF also supports an extensive server, lab, and networking
infrastructure for the [Econometrics
Laboratory](https://eml.berkeley.edu) of the Department of Economics.
