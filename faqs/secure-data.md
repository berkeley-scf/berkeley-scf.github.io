If you intend to work with data of a secure nature on the SCF, please
contact us before transferring it. Campus policy documents [data
classification and protection
levels](https://security.berkeley.edu/policy/data-classification-standard/data-classification-and-protection-levels)
and we want to make sure that potential loss of data or resource
confidentiality, integrity, or availability does not negatively impact
individuals or campus. We do not expect to host data above P2 -- the
[Protection Level Classification
Table](https://security.berkeley.edu/data-classification-standard) can
help you determine the data's classification level. Additionally, you
can reach out to the consultants at [Research Data
Management](https://researchdata.berkeley.edu/consulting) for more
guidance.
