title: "The UNIX command line and the bash shell"
---
SCF resources are commonly accessed by logging into one of the SCF
machines, which will put you into a UNIX command line interface. More
specifically, by default, you'll be interacting with the machine through
the bash shell. (But note that we also provide browser-based
interactivity through our [JupyterHub service](/software/jupyterhub).)

For more information, the SCF has developed:

- an introductory tutorial about the [UNIX command
  line](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-unix-basics) and
- a more advanced tutorial about the [bash
  shell](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash).

We also recommend Software Carpentry's [UNIX
shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) workshop for novices
(with an [accompanying
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c1BL5b47kg).)).
