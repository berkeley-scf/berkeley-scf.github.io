## Shopping Process

If you will be purchasing a computer off of a grant or from departmental
funds, please follow the instructions below.

1.  Visit [BearBuy](https://bearbuy.is.berkeley.edu/). If you are
    connecting from an off-campus network, connect to the [campus
    VPN](/node/5056) first.
2.  Scroll down the BearBuy page and choose the store from which you
    will be making the purchases, for example, Apple or Dell.
3.  Locate the items in the store you want to buy and add them to your
    shopping cart.
4.  When you are finished adding items, check out from the store as you
    normally would by clicking "check out", "done", "finish", etc.
    Instead of being prompted to enter payment details or shipping
    addresses, you will be returned to the BearBuy site along with your
    cart.
5.  At the top-right of BearBuy, click "Assign Cart" to send your cart
    to a departmental staff person who will complete the ordering
    process for you. If this cart will be purchased on a grant, assign
    your cart to the department's Research Administrator, otherwise
    assign it to the Financial Analyst. Click "Search for an assignee"
    to search for that person's name, then click their name when you
    find it.
6.  You may also choose to enter some comments here that the assignee
    will see when they are assigned your cart. If this purchase is off
    of a grant, describe which grant and indicate why you need the item
    (as usually required by grants). If this is from other funds, add
    other background information so that staff can expeditiously process
    your request. Then click on "Assign" on the right side.

### Apple Store

BearBuy features an Apple logo in the main page, however that button
takes you to CDWG's store. While they do carry Apple equipment, it may
be more expensive than if you purchase through the Apple Store. CDWG
also offers fewer configurations than the Apple Store. To get to the
online Apple Store through BearBuy:

1.  Click "Suppliers" near the top right, after the label "Browse".
2.  Click "Click to expand Search for Supplier Filter".
3.  Type "Apple" in the Supplier field and click Search.
4.  One of the first results is usually "APPLE COMPUTER INC". Click the
    entry's icon in the "Type" column to proceed to the Apple Store
    punchout.
5.  As in the instructions above, when you go to checkout, your cart
    will be brought back to BearBuy.

## Recommendations

- We highly recommend purchasing service contracts on your computers
  such as AppleCare on Apple items or 3-5 year contracts from the other
  vendors.
- If you will be buying an Apple laptop and want to connect it to a
  projector, make sure to add a USB-C to HDMI adapter.
- You do not need to purchase Microsoft Office with your computer since
  you are eligible to [download it for
  free](https://software.berkeley.edu/microsoft).
