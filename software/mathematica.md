## Wolfram Alpha Pro

[Wolfram Alpha Pro](http://www.wolframalpha.com) provides web access to
the kinds of computations you might do in the Mathematica application.
For full functionality, you'll need a Wolfram ID and subscription to
Wolfram Alpha Pro.

1.  If you don't already have a Wolfram ID, create one using your
    Berkeley email address as your ID at [this
    link](https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/6984324ef82fc06b6e14e27062c95ca8949aa92d) (also
    available through
    <a href="https://software.berkeley.edu/mathematica#Downloads"
    target="_blank">https://software.berkeley.edu/mathematica#Downloads</a>).
2.  Fill out the Wolfram Pro subscription request form on the page you
    are redirected to.
3.  Follow the instructions provided to confirm your Berkeley email
    address in the email sent to you.

Once you have this set up, you should be able to use your Berkeley email
and the password you just set up to sign in to [Wolfram
Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com).
