## Setting up the Television

You can turn on the TV by pressing the large red power button on the
remote. There are three ways of displaying content from your computer to
the TV: using a VGA cable, using an HDMI cable, and wireless via
Chromecast. The two cables are coiled at the front of the room behind
the cabinet. Choose whichever cable can connect to your laptop with or
without a video dongle. Press the Input button on the remote, then use
the arrows to select either VGA Cable, HDMI Cable, or Chromecast.

There are controls on the wall by the podium to lower or raise the
projector screen.

### Troubleshooting

If you are using a Mac and the TV complains about the
resolution, you may need to tell your Mac to adjust the display size it
is sending to the TV. One strategy of doing this is through System
Preferences \> Display and unchecking **Mirror Display**. If this does
not address the issue, click **Gather Windows**, then select the **SHARP
LCD** window and adjust the resolution. Its best guess might be
sufficient, otherwise select 1920x1080 if available.
