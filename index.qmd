The Statistical Computing Facility (SCF) is a unit of the academic Department of Statistics, formally organized in 1986. We provide computing, networking, and information resources to the community of students, faculty, and staff of the Statistics Department and the Econometrics Laboratory of the Department of Economics in support of the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service. It is staffed by a Director of Computing, a Statistical Computing Consultant, and a UNIX System Administrator.

We have additional documentation at the [department's website](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing).
