UC Berkeley offers a variety of [Wi-Fi network access
  services](https://berkeley.service-now.com/itservicehub/en/network-connectivity-management/campus-wi-fi?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=499204de87b18ed0a4fdeb1e3fbb353f&in_context=true), with *eduroam* the
  recommended service for most devices.

To use [eduroam](https://berkeley.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0013808) you mustÂ [create a Wi-Fi key](https://wifi-keys.berkeley.edu/) in order to connect as a member of campus. [eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) is a cross-institution Wi-Fi access service. If your device can connect to eduroam with any credentials at any institution, it can connect at Berkeley, and vice versa.


There is also [Berkeley-Visitor](https://berkeley.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0014552) for visitors to campus.
