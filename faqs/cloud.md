Cloud computing enables researchers to do massive statistical
calculations on virtual clusters hosted by organizations such as
[Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Google Cloud (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).

The basic steps involved are setting up accounts at a provider,
configuring (with the software you need) and starting virtual machines
for computation, running your computations and monitoring usage and
billing, and returning the results to your local machine.

## bCloud

Campus' [bCloud Public Cloud
Service](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KyhdetJgjUI8eivoJn1HWaeuY7eKTRrmmn3D-txdg3o/edit#slide=id.gcfb890c19a_0_28)
can help researchers by providing UC discounts, centralized billing
(using a charstring instead of a credit card), CalNet authentication,
and other methods of support. We encourage people to leverage this
service to ease various administrative burdens involved with using the
cloud.
