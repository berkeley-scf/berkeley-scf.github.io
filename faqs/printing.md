## Student Printing

If you are an undergraduate student, you may print at one of the many
[library and residence hall
locations](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/resources/printing-residence-halls-and-libraries).

## Departmental Printing

Departmental printing is done through our (black and white) Xerox
copiers and a color printer in the mail/copy room in the main
office. All documents you print will count towards your copier page
total.

### Obtain a Copier ID

You will need to have a copier User ID created for you before you can
use the copiers. If you already have a code for making copies and
scanning to email, you can reuse this for printing. Please see the the
front office manager in 367 for this.

### From the Web

#### Copiers

The Xerox AltaLink B8090 copiers have web interfaces where you can
upload your document to print. Your file will need to converted to a
print ready file format such as PDF or PostScript. All Macs have
built-in print-to-PDF capability. Visit either copier's web page linked
below, upload your document, set your print job's parameters, enter your
copier account credentials, then click Submit Job at the top.

#### Color Printer

The Xerox VersaLink C8000 color printer can receive documents to print
in the same manner as the copiers, but the login process is slightly
different. Click "Log In" at the top right of the printer's web page.
Find your name under "User Accounts", then enter your copier code in the
"Password Required" field when prompted. Then click "Submit File" at the
bottom of the page to upload your document.

If you want to print to the copiers from your personal computer by using
the native print capability, you will need to [download and install
Xerox
drivers](https://www.support.xerox.com/en-us/product/altalink-b8000-series/downloads),
then create a print queue. On Windows, download the Xerox Smart Start
application.

<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">When installing the driver, the
installer may try to automatically find the Xerox copiers on the network
and install the print queue for you. You can click on a button, usually
the right-most of three large square buttons, to specify one of the
Xeroxes above.</span>

If the driver installer did not create the queue, you will need to do
this manually. On a Mac visit System Preferences \> Print & Fax to add a
printer. Choose one of the printer addresses, and set the Protocol to
"HP Jetdirect - Socket" and leave the Queue field blank. Specify the
B8090 driver you just installed.

When printing this way, make sure you are on campus ethernet or are on
eduroam. Printing from CalVisitor will not work.

The Mac may respond with, "Unable to verify the printer on your
network," which is fine. 

On a Windows computer, if the app doesn't discover the copiers, click
"Don't See Your Printer?" and enter the network address manually -- one
of x1.stat.berkeley.edu or x2.stat.berkeley.edu.

Once you have added the queue, you will need to configure it with your
copier ID.

You will need navigate to where you can enter your ID.

### macOS

Note that these features do not work on macOS 13 (Ventura) and above for
some people. The print dialog windows will be blank. As a workaround,
you must upload your document to the Xerox web pages linked above.

1.  Choose the desired Xerox copier from the standard print dialog
    window, e.g. File \> Print, when you first need to print.
2.  Find the print options pop-up menu (usually set to **Layout** on
    first viewing) and select **Xerox Features** and then **Advanced**.
    The print dialog box should resemble what you see here:

Click the Accounting... button. In the new windows, set Accounting
System to *Xerox Standard Accounting*. Set Default User ID to your
copier user ID. Leave Default Account Type as "Default Group Account".
If you have multiple codes, you can choose to have it prompt you for
each print job. Here are the accounting settings:

### Windows

1.  Open the Printers and Faxes, or Devices and Printers window.
2.  Click on the printer, and then "Open printer app".
3.  Click on the "Device Settings" button on the right.
4.  Click "Print Queue Settings" on the left, then Accounting.
5.  Under Default User ID, enter your copy code.

<div class="tab-pane-content">

If you frequently print to the Xerox copiers, you may find it
inconvenient to have to enter the User ID and Account ID every time you
print. If so, you can save that information to a printer "Preset" that
can be automatically applied whenever you use the Xerox. Fill in the
accounting information as specified above, but before you finish and
click **Print**, do the following:

</div>

### macOS

<div class="tab-pane-content">

1.  Click the pop-up menu next to **Presets**.
2.  Choose **Save Current Settings as Preset...**.
3.  In the dialog window that pops up, assign a name to the Preset such
    as "Xerox with Account ID". Next to **Preset Available For** choose
    **Only this printer**.
4.  Click **OK**. Whenever you want to print without having to enter
    your User and Account IDs, just make sure to select the preset in
    the **Presets** pop-up menu.

### Troubleshooting

- If the Xeroxes accept your job but do not want to print it, and cite
  resource constraints with any or all of the paper trays, your document
  might not be formatted for 8.5"x11" paper. On macOS in Preview, you
  can see the size of the document under Tools \> Show Inspector. You
  can often reformat your document to an acceptable print size by
  printing it to PDF. You can then upload that PDF to the copiers.
