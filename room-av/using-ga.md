## Overview

This document provides tips for recording in-person class sessions and
presenting remotely via Zoom from a classroom (e.g., for a hybrid
in-person + remote class session)

This document assumes that instructors want to record “board work”
(which might not be an actual board) as well as computer
presentations/demos. If not, then simply joining the Zoom meeting from
your laptop and using screen sharing should suffice (or signing up for
Course Capture for recordings for asynchronous viewing). 

There are two basic categories of recording with cameras for board work.

- Many general assignment (GA) campus classrooms are equipped with
  recording equipment that can capture board work and audio. These rooms
  are noted as having “Feature: Video Conference Capable” or “Feature:
  Camera without Operator” in ETS's [classroom
  database](https://www.ets.berkeley.edu/classroom-database). Rooms
  without these features can only record the screen and in-room lapel
  mic via Course Capture (or the screen and laptop mic when recording
  via Zoom).
- (DIY) In the remaining campus rooms and in the Stat department 3rd
  floor rooms, cameras are not available and other approaches are
  needed, as discussed below.

More details on each option are discussed next.

## GA classrooms

### Course capture (asynchronous)

You can opt to have course capture enabled for your class (instructors
should receive an email about this before the semester starts). In this
case, your presentation (including the board via in the in-room camera
and projector) should be recorded and made available automatically in
the Course Capture section of bCourses. Make sure you point the camera
as desired using the camera control buttons on the in-room touchscreen.
You can choose to focus the camera on one of the boards if you wish.
Also make sure to use the in-room lapel mic. 

### Zoom recording (synchronous and asynchronous)

Alternatively, you can present remotely (and also record) via Zoom (or
other video conferencing tools such as Google Meet). These rooms are set
up such that one can use the in-room camera and audio in the Zoom
meeting, rather than your laptop's webcam and mic. You will need to:

- Start the meeting and make sure it is being recorded.
- Connect your laptop to the AV equipment in the room (which may be
  labelled “PA out”). You will need to bring a USB cable to connect to
  the in-room equipment. Most older laptops will need a USB-A to USB-B
  cable, and many newer laptops will need a USB-C to USB-B cable.
  Statistics affiliates can usually check out cables and related dongles
  from the Statistics main office, but consult the SCF in case of
  problems.

- Make sure that the room camera, mic, and speakers are selected as the
  camera, mic, and speakers to be used by Zoom by selecting
  “ExtronMediaPort” (this might be named something different in some
  rooms) after clicking the caret symbols next to the camera and
  microphone buttons in the bottom left of the Zoom meeting screen. 
- If you have a newer MacBook that requires use of a port for charging
  and only has two ports, note that connecting to the projector and
  connecting for the Zoom room functionality require two ports, so if
  you need to charge while teaching you will need some sort of device
  that serves to expand the number of ports. The SCF can help with this.

As with Course Capture, you can choose to focus the camera on one of the
boards if you wish, and you should make sure to use the in-room lapel
mic. While presenting, make sure to turn screen sharing on and off as
appropriate to control what the remote/recording viewers see. 

Based on an initial test, we believe that when using the in-room lapel
mic that students in the room and those viewing the recordings or
joining remotely will be able to hear the instructor fine.

See the [ETS help video](https://kaltura.berkeley.edu/media/1_gmvyrej2)
for more details on controlling the camera, mic, and using Zoom with the
room technology.

### DIY (Do-It-Yourself) Capture

The options for DIY capture include the following. All assume you are
using Zoom or Google Meet to record your lecture.

- Use a tablet (e.g., an iPad) or document camera so that your "board
  work" is routed through the computer and captured by sharing the
  relevant screen with your Zoom meeting. In-person students will see
  the board work on the projector screen.
- Use your phone to capture the (actual) board by having the phone join
  the meeting as another participant, with the phone in an SCF-provided
  holder/tripod. 
  - As you move from your laptop to the board, Zoom will automatically
    switch the view from the laptop to the phone to capture the board
    work. Zoom does this by detecting where the audio input is louder.
  - You will probably need to stop screen sharing when you move to the
    board. 
  - You could also have the “presenter” always be the phone, but for
    reasonable audio quality, you may want to be careful you are not too
    far from the phone in that case. 
  - Positioning the phone closer to the board and using a blackboard
    rather than a whiteboard may result in higher/sufficient quality.
- Use an SCF-provided external Logitech camera (which can be attached to
  an SCF-provided tripod) or other loaner camera from the SCF or ETS to
  capture the (actual) board.
