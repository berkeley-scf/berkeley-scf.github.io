title: "Rules for using the wired network"
---
This document is an overview of your individual responsibilities when
you use your connect your personal computer equipment to the SCF
network. These procedures are necessary in order to ensure that our
users and the campus community have a secure network environment. Most
of the procedures described below are addressed to users running under a
Windows operating system.

The SCF is not responsible for the integrity or security of personal
computer equipment that is connected to the SCF network. It is the
responsibility of the user to fix any problems associated with his or
her personal computer equipment. The SCF will attempt to answer
questions to the best of our ability. Additional information regarding
Campus IT policies can be found at

## Safety

Before you can establish either a network connection with your personal
computer:

1.  Install the latest security and critical patches on the computer.
    Both the Windows and Mac operating systems provide users with a
    mechanism to automatically update their system with current patches.
    Windows users can click the Windows Update or Microsoft Update
    buttons under the Start Menu, and Mac users can click the Software
    Update in the System Preferences program
2.  Users running Windows or Mac operating systems must have an active
    subscription to an anti-virus service such as Symantec (available at
    http://software-central.berkeley.edu) and have the latest anti-virus
    updates installed. Recommendations:
    - The anti-virus software should be configured to perform automatic
      updates and to scan upon booting and to scan all incoming
      documents.
    - If your computer has firewall software installed, turn-on the
      firewall software to block all services except Incoming Echo (ICMP
      ping). Some platforms, such as Windows XP, has firewall software
      installed.
    - If you are running under a Windows operating system, it is
      recommended that you switch to a more secure computing
      environment, such as Linux or Mac OS X.
    - Perform frequent back-ups of your data (at least once a week).
3.  You must set an administrator password on your machine. Log in to
    your computer with the administrator or root account and see if the
    password is what you think it is.
4.  Users should only connect their computers to the purple cables that
    are provided in the rooms. Users are not permitted to connect any
    other equipment (such as a switch or a hub) to the SCF network and
    should never disconnect or move any cable connected to the network
    panels located in the rooms.

## Recovery

In the event of a compromise that impacts the security of other
computers (such as your computer being used to launch attacks on other
computers):

- Your account will be immediately blocked. We will attempt to notify
  you by phone or alternate email address.
- You will not be allowed to connect to the SCF network until the
  infected software has been removed. Contact the SCF to have your
  account reactivated after you have verified that the infected software
  has been removed and that you have installed the latest patches and
  anti-virus software.
