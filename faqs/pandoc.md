title: "Using pandoc to convert between document formats"
---
You can use the program pandoc on the SCF Linux and Mac machines (via
the terminal window) to convert from formats such as HTML, LaTeX and
Markdown to formats such as HTML, LaTeX, Word, OpenOffice, and PDF,
among others.

See the man page for pandoc or the [Pandoc
webpage](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for more details.

In brief experimentation, some mathematical notation in LaTeX was
converted well into equations in Word or OpenOffice, but some user
modifications may be required.
