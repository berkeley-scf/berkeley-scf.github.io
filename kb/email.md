## \@berkeley.edu Email Accounts

Nearly anyone with a CalNet ID is eligible to create an \@berkeley.edu
account via theÂ [Create
accounts and lists](https://mybconnected.berkeley.edu/my/account/index)
wizard at [bConnected](http://bconnected.berkeley.edu/).
\@berkeley.edu accounts are backed by GMail under the "bMail" monicker.
Similarly, Google Calendar and Google Drive are known as "bCal" and
"bDrive". If you are having trouble using your \@berkeley.edu account,
follow the support linkes at bConnected.

## \@stat.berkeley.edu Email Address

As of September 28, 2012, the issuance of new \@stat.berkeley.edu
personal email accounts will be limited to permanent faculty only.
Previously, \@stat email accounts were automatically created
simultaneously with SCF computing accounts, however this is no longer
the case with the migration to CalMail. This decision was made by the
SCF Systems Manager in consultation with the Department Chair and MSO.
