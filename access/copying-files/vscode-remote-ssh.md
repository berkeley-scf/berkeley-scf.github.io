The [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) VS Code extension lets you access your SCF files from within your local VS Code instance. Connect to any SCF login server, browse your files, and edit them directly within VS Code running on your device.
