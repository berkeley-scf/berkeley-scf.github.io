title: "Connecting a computer to the wired network"
---
The campus manages the newer wired network connections on the 3rd and
4th floors of Evans Hall in addition to the eduroam and CalVisitor
wireless networks. This article describes the steps necessary to connect
your computer to the wired network. Please refer to the
<a href="computing/connect-rules" data-_mce_href="/830">rules</a> for
accessing the network with a personal computer before proceeding.

1.  Determine your ethernet address  
    Every computer's ethernet interface has a unique identifier assigned
    to it (akin to a serial number) made up of twelve hexadecimal
    numbers, 0 - f, e.g. 01:23:45:67:89:ab. This identifier is often
    called a MAC, ethernet, or hardware address, and must be registered
    with campus before you can connect. Determine your MAC address using
    either [our instructions](/node/4150) or
    [campus'](https://berkeley.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010261).

2.  Register your ethernet address with campus

    Log in to [IST's SocReg site](https://socreg.berkeley.edu) and
    follow [their
    instructions](https://security.berkeley.edu/services/socreg-asset-registration-portal/registered-assets/dhcp-device-registration).

3.  Configure your computer's network settings  
    You should configure your computer's ethernet port to use DHCP. This
    is usually the default, or "Automatic", setting. If you haven't
    manually modified your laptop to work with a specific network, your
    default network settings should work in the department.

4.  Connect the wire  
    Most rooms on Evans Hall 3rd and 4th floors should have purple
    colored network cables for you to use. If your room does not have
    one or does not have enough, please
    [email](mailto:trouble@stat.berkeley.edu) us and specify the office
    room number. Make sure the purple cable is connected to the small
    white network box -- it is about the size of a deck of cards. The
    larger white network boxes are incompatible with this process.
    Please do not disconnect any SCF-managed computers from cables since
    faculty and students may be accessing the equipment remotely.

## Troubleshooting

This information is provided for members of the Statistics Department.
If you are in a residence hall or are in another unit, please consult
your technical support staff there. 

Check that your purple cable is plugged into the small white networking
boxes (the size of a deck of cards) on the wall rather than the larger
white boxes. The small boxes are associated with cabling that was
installed by campus during the summer of 2014. The above procedure will
only work if your computer is connected via a purple cable to the small
box.
