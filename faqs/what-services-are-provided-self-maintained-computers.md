## [Files](/mount-homedir)

Users can directly read from and write to their UNIX home directories
and web areas. This service is provided by Samba and may require that
the user have the same account name on their computer as they do on the
SCF.

## Network

Access to the internet is available either by a [wired connection
through the department network](/connect-network) or by a
[wireless connection to campus](https://technology.berkeley.edu/wi-fi).
Personal computers can only be connected to the network using an SCF
provided purple cable. You will first need to register the MAC address
of your computer with the SCF in order to get DHCP service (refer to
help laptop for details). If you do not have a purple cable in your
office, contact the SCF staff to install a purple cable for use with
your computer. If you have a CalNet ID and a wireless network card, you
can get internet access using the eduroam wireless network service.
eduroam service is available to all offices within the Department of
Statistics.

## Consulting

The SCF will provide information and recommendations on how to resolve
problems and give advice on the administration of computers. This
information will be provided to the best of our ability and is limited
to information that we have at hand.
