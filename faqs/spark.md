title: "MapReduce and Distributed Computing Using Spark"
---
MapReduce and the Hadoop framework for implementing distributed
computing provide an approach for working with extremely large datasets
distributed across a network of machines. Spark, developed by the AmpLab
here at Berkeley, is a recent implementation of these ideas that tries
to keep computations in the collective memory of the network of machines
to speed computations, particularly iterative algorithms.

We have prepared a tutorial, including template code, on using Spark for
data processing, simulation, and statistical model fitting. The tutorial
includes information about starting up an Amazon virtual cluster using
Spark's EC2 script. 

The tutorial and template code are [available on
github](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/spark-workshop-2014).  The HTML
of the tutorial is also [available
here](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/scf/paciorek-spark-2014.html). You
can clone the repository with a git clone, which can be done from the
Linux/Mac command line as:

``` programlisting
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-scf/spark-workshop-2014
```

Here are screencasts of the [first session](http://youtu.be/0iAkbOI-MMg)
and the [second session](https://youtu.be/fyAHKG_lvhc) of Chris
Paciorek's workshop on Spark.

<span style="line-height: 22px;">In addition, please note that Spark is
available on the campus-wide Savio cluster.  Materials from a workshop
given by Chris Paciorek that covers use of Spark on both AWS and Savio,
but with less detail than the other materials
