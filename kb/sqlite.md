title: Working with SQLite and DuckDB
---
This page provides an overview of using databases, in particular SQLite 
and DuckDB. These are standalone, self-contained databases that are easy
to use on your own machine as they are not client-server databases.
Each database in these systems is simply a file.

Note that if you need a more powerful client-server database management
system (DBMS), such as postgreSQL, please [contact
us](mailto:consult@stat.berkeley.edu). 

SQLite and DuckDB are available on all of the SCF Linux machines.
If you need the DuckDB command line interface, we are happy to
install it for you.

You can work with SQLite and DuckDB databases directly using their
commandline interfaces or via Python or R (or other languages).  For more information
see the [SCF databases tutorial](https://computing.stat.berkeley.edu/tutorial-databases#accessing-a-database-and-using-sql-from-other-languages).
