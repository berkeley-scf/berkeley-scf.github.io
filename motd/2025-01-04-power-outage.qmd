## Investigating 2025-01-04 9:27a

I just received word that there is a power outage affecting the north side of campus. Unfortunately this has hit our server rooms and all systems are down. Iâ€™ll respond with updates when I know more. 

## Monitoring 2025-01-04 11:06a

Power is still out in Evans Hall. Emergency lights are on, and the card readers are not functional. 

## Resolved 2025-01-04 4:00p

Campus issued WarnMe notifications that power was restored Saturday afternoon. Most machines were brought up by 4p or so, although some need local attention so I'll bring them up Monday.
