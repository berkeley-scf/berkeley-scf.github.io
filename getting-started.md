title: "Statistical Computing Facility"
---
The Statistical Computing Facility (SCF) is a unit of the academic
Department of Statistics, formally organized in 1986. We provide
computing, networking, and information resources to the community of
students, faculty, and staff of the Statistics Department and the
Econometrics Laboratory of the Department of Economics in support of the
University's mission of teaching, research, and public service. It is
staffed by a Director of Computing, a Statistical Computing Consultant,
and a UNIX System Administrator.

We have [this template text](/support/facilities) (i.e., "facilities
statement") describing the SCF and other department resources that is
suitable for grant proposals.

  recommended service for most devices. To use eduroam you must [create a Wi-Fi
  key](https://wifi-keys.berkeley.edu/) in order to connect as a member of
  campus. [eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) is a cross-institution Wi-Fi access
  service. If your device can connect to eduroam with any credentials at any
  institution, it can connect at Berkeley, and vice versa.
