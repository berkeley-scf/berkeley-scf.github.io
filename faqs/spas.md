The Statistics Department uses [CalNet
SPA](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa)
accounts to manage shared access to email, calendar, and document
storage.

## Prepare Your Web Browser

When you log in to any \@berkeley.edu account using the standard CalNet
login page, your web browser saves session information such as your
CalNet ID. As a result, visiting any other CalNet-based site in the same
browser session gives you automatic access without requiring logging in
again. If you would like to be able to access your personal
\@berkeley.edu account in a web browser *while simultaneously accessing*
the SPA account, you will need to do one of the following:

- Use one web browser for your personal \@berkeley.edu account and use
  another browser for your SPA. For example you can use Chrome for your
  personal and Firefox for your SPA, or vice versa.
- Use a private browsing session for the SPA.
  - Chrome: File \> New Incognito Window
  - Firefox: File \> New Private Window
  - Safari: Safari \> Private Browsing...
- ​Create a separate user account within your web browser. This lets you
  keep your primary browser cookies and data separate from those
  associated with the SPA.
  - ​Chrome: Settings \> People \> Add person...

If you want to keep things simple and bypass the above, you can just log
in to your SPA with the expectation that you will not be able to access
your personal \@berkeley.edu until you restart your browser.

## CalNet Authentication

Once you have prepared your browser and want to access resources
belonging to the SPA, for example its bMail, bCal, bDrive, or Box
storage, visit the respective site and wait for it to prompt you for
CalNet Authentication. If you do not get prompted it means that you are
already logged in to a CalNet account in which case you will need to
restart your browser or use one of the techniques above. Otherwise, when
prompted for CalNet credentials, do one of the following: (these
examples use "myname" as your personal CalNet ID and "mygroup" as the
name of the SPA)

- Instead of typing just your personal CalNet ID, type your CalNet ID
  preceded by a "+", for example "+myname". Then type your personal
  CalNet passphrase as usual. When you click Sign In, the next page will
  have a pop-up menu where you can select the SPA as "spa-mygroup".
  Choose it, then click Sign In As.
- Enter "spa-mygroup+myname" as your CalNet ID. Then type your personal
  CalNet passphrase as usual.

Anything you do in the browsing session such as accessing bmail or bcal
or any other service which uses CalNet will be done as the SPA. If you
need to login to a service as your personal \@berkeley.edu account, use
one of the techniques above.
