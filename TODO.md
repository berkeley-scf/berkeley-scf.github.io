title: Todo items
---

- [ ] Check links
- [ ] Make "getting-started" info easier to find - perhaps a top-level item?
- [ ] We could put info about "access" and "account" under "getting started"
- [ ] Have `accounts` be a top-level item?
- [ ] Have `contact us` be a top-level item?
- [ ] I'm inclined to remove the "Beyond" external resources as they are quite haphazard. 
- [ ] Look through "External Resources" and add pointers to Research IT, NAIRR and ACCESS, possibly OCF, D-Lab.
- [ ] "Using secure shell (SSH)" should be under some access-type location not under Software
- [ ] Remove old "Dual GPU server" page
- [ ] Some FAQs pages are missing from the "Knowledge Base" listing, e.g., Samba mounting, X11 forwarding, and Wi-Fi guest access.
- [ ] The Tutorials page is missing some of the older ones. Also some of the titles need updating.
- [ ] The Training subsection needs a lot of work. Some of the items are very outdated. We might just want Workshops at the top level instead of "Training".
- [ ] We might consider leaving the SCF Mission and History pages on statistics.b.e and having this site be focused on documentation. We might also leave Room A/v, Tech Lending, and Security on the main site.
- [ ] The current Security page is missing.
- [ ] Perhaps the heading on statistics.b.e should be "Information Technology" rather than "Computing" once we move the SCF documentation off the dep't site.
