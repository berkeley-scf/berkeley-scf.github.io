title: "How do I change my password?"
---

Your password serves as a security check to protect your account from
unauthorized users. Anyone who knows your password can login to your
account. It is a good idea to change your password on a regular basis.

Use the `passwd` command to change your password. The system will
prompt you for your old password as well as your new one. Your old
password is the one you signed on with and your new password is one of
your choice. Passwords must observe the following restrictions:

1.  Must be at least 12 characters.
1.  Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
1.  Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
1.  Must contain at least one digit, e.g. 0-9.
1.  Must contain at least one special character, e.g.,
    !@#\$%^&\*()\_+\|~- =\\{}\[\]:";'\<\>?,./).
1.  Cannot contain common words from various languages, popular names,
    and frequently used passwords, or their variations, e.g.
    \`p@ssw0rd\`.

When you respond to the system's prompts for your old and new passwords,
what you type will not be displayed on the screen.

If you type your old password correctly, set a legitimate new password,
and retype your new password without any mistakes, the computer will
return its shell prompt indicating that your new password is currently
in effect and the system is ready to accept commands. If you make a
mistake, the computer will return an error message and you must begin
again.

If you forget your password, contact the system staff.
