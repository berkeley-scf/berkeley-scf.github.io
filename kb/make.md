title: "Using Make to manage analysis workflows and build software"
---
Make is a command line tool that can help to automate building software
and executing analysis pipelines.

We have a presentation/demo prepared on the use of make to automate
various tasks:

- data analysis workflows
- paper/presentation preparation
- building and installing software

The tutorial and template code are [available on
github](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/make-thw-2015).Â  The HTML of the
tutorial is also [available
here](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/scf/paciorek-make-2015.html). You can
clone the repository with a git clone, which can be done from the
Linux/Mac command line as:

``` programlisting
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-scf/make-thw-2015
```
